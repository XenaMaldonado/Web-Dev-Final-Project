      <h2>Where do these beauty standards come from?</h2>
      <p>From a very young age, women are raised to live up to unrealistic beauty standards put upon them by society.
        They are expected to be hairless all over their body, have to be slim with no tummy but big butt, smell like daisies and roses all the time, not have regular bodily fluids and gases, and be an all-around perfect Barbie.
        It is hard to live up to something so unobtainable especially starting at an age as low as three. Having a normalized yet extraordinary societal implication drilled into you as soon as you are out of the womb is and can be mentally and physically draining. <br> <br> </p>
      <p>It tends to be all over. In social media, magazines, newspapers, and even televisions tend to push on barely acheivable standards. You must look a certain way for society to at least acknowledge your "beauty." even when you try to mold yourself to please them. Still, there is always criticism behind it. <br> <br> </p>

      <h2>How does it affect us?</h2>
      <p>America’s preposterous beauty standards are everywhere—in social media, on television, in merchandise - it is impossible to ignore them. Girls are being incessantly bombarded with what the “perfect” girl looks like and feel pressured to live by those standards. Some girls start to have an obsession with false beauty and try to conform to imposed standards of beauty. One form of changing one's apprearance is to photoshop one's image.
      It allows girls to slim down their legs, widen their eyes and erase every stretch mark or scar. Seeing all these unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards get in to the brain of the youth and allow them to question to beauty. And many will modify themselves to become someone different. </p>
